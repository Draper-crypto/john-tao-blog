``` shell

./composer.json has been updated
Running composer update extiverse/mercury

  Problem 1
    - extiverse/mercury[0.1.2, ..., 0.2.0] require extiverse/api-client ^0.2.1 -> satisfiable by extiverse/api-client[0.2.1, ..., 0.2.6].
    - extiverse/mercury[0.1, ..., 0.1.1] require extiverse/api-client ^0.2 -> satisfiable by extiverse/api-client[0.2, ..., 0.2.6].
    - extiverse/api-client[0.2, ..., 0.2.4] require guzzlehttp/guzzle 7.3.* -> found guzzlehttp/guzzle[7.3.0] but the package is fixed to 7.8.1 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - extiverse/api-client 0.2.5 requires guzzlehttp/guzzle 7.3.* || 7.4.* -> found guzzlehttp/guzzle[7.3.0, ..., 7.4.5] but the package is fixed to 7.8.1 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - extiverse/api-client 0.2.6 requires guzzlehttp/guzzle 7.3.* || 7.4.* || 7.5.* -> found guzzlehttp/guzzle[7.3.0, ..., 7.5.3] but the package is fixed to 7.8.1 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
    - Root composer.json requires extiverse/mercury * -> satisfiable by extiverse/mercury[0.1, ..., 0.2.0].

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
